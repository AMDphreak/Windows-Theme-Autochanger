## License
Windows Theme Auto-Dark Mode is licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit">MIT license</a>.

## Documentation
Documentation is done in Writerside from Jetbrains. Documentation can be edited in MD (Markdown) format in a text editor,
however, the Writerside tool provides validation of syntax. We recommend installing Writerside through Jetbrains'
Toolbox App, to manage versions and keep updates simple. This documentation has been initialized using

*Writerside 2024.3 EAP | Build #WRS-243.21565.432, built on November 8, 2024*

Any errors or breakage of documentation should be reported to the project on <a href="https://github.com/AMDphreak">
GitHub Issues</a> in the project's Docs Repository.

## Development Environment
Windows Theme Auto-Dark Mode is developed in <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a>. We chose Go because it is simple and
stupid, and excels at being easy to pick up for traditionally-educated C, C++, Java, and Python Developers. It follows
design principles similar to C++. Simple and stupid is an asset for collaboration. Go also adheres to the abstractions
that make computer science a science, including the Turing Machine, rather than a practice, like cooking. Easy, well
understood principles drive communication better than clever but over-abstract code.
