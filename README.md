# Windows Theme Autochanger

Windows Theme Autochanger automatically sets your Windows Theme to a pre-defined Dark Mode at night and Light Mode during the day. Both can be set. You can also have the app not change theme background and only change the window controls color mode.

The app runs in the background as a service and has an app icon that runs in the System Tray. You can enable or disable the service from the app or System Tray icon.
